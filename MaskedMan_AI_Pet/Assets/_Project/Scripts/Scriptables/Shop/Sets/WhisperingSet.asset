  itemName: Matryoshka of Secrets
  itemDesc: Nested within each intricately painted doll lies a sinister secret. When
    the outermost doll is opened, it emits a faint, haunting whisper that draws the
    listener closer, compelling them to reveal their deepest fears and desires. With
    each subsequent doll opened, the whispers grow louder and more insistent, delving
    into darker realms of the subconscious until the final doll is reached. Within
    this innermost chamber lies a mirror reflecting the listener's true self, echoing
    their innermost thoughts with chilling clarity. But beware, for once the Matryoshka
    of Secrets is opened, its whispers never truly fade, lingering in the mind long
    after the dolls are closed.
